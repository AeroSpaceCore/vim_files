Hi
==

This is my [vim](http://www.vim.org/ "VIM") configuration. It's based in [justinlilly](https://github.com/justinlilly) 
[vim_files](https://github.com/justinlilly/vim_files), but I've was adding several plugins and themes so it's too late
to be kind and fork it's project.
There are also some ticks stolen from [cuerty's](https://github.com/cuerty) [dotfile](https://github.com/cuerty/dotfiles).

It's specially configured to be used in [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/), [Python](http://www.python.org/), CSS, 
HTML and JavaScript and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) development, which are the languages and frameworks I use in a 
daily basis (and that I love).
